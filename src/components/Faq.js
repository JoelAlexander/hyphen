      <h4>What is an Ethereum blockchain?</h4>
      <p>
        An Ethereum blockchain is a public computer which is administered by a network of computers called peers.
        Peers make the blockchain resilient by backing up the data stored on the blockchain and holding eachother accountable to run programs correctly according to their rules.
        Data and programs on the blockchain are public and may be accessed and used by anyone with access to a peer.</p>
